📌 Overview

This repository contains my complete hands-on practice code written while studying the book
Python Crash Course (3rd Edition) by Eric Matthes.

Every program, example, and concept in this book has been typed, executed, and understood line-by-line by me, rather than copied or auto-generated.
The purpose of this repository is learning by implementation, not just reference.
